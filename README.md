# Accessibility and Usage of Libraries in Chicago

This project seeks to explore the accessibility and usage trends of libraries in Chicago on the basis of geographic accessibility and income.

The main takeaways:

- There seems to be a service gap geographically within higher income zip codes, which can be explained by the lesser square mileage. However, a similar service gap exists in the southern portion of Chicago which cannot be explained by population density.

- There is a correlation between the number of visits a library gets and its income level, when normalizing by the population of the zip code. It is unclear how much of this is attributed to the income of the zip code itself, as there are numerous confounding factors such as lack of libraries in neighboring zip codes as well as the proximity to hubs of tourism.

- There is no correlation between the number of computer sessions and its income level, when normalizing by the population. This itself is an interesting conclusion that merited further exploration. One would expect to see a correlation that is similar to the visit correlation due to the necessity of visits for computer sessions to occur in the first place.

- When normalized by the number of visits, there is a clear correlation between the median household of a zip code and how much the computer is utilized.

- Deeper analysis regarding library accessibility and usage should address factors not captured in the datasets, such as the attitudes of residents affecting their engagement with their local library and the discrepancy in computer resources between libraries.
